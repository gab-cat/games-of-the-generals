## üîß Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security Guidelines

#### Secure Coding Practices

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Input validation
function validateUsername(username: string): boolean {
  const usernameRegex = /^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{3,20}$/;
  return usernameRegex.test(username);
}

// ‚ùå Bad: No validation
function processUsername(username: string) {
  // Direct use without validation
  return username;
}
```

#### Authentication & Authorization

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Proper authorization checks
export const makeMove = mutation({
  args: { gameId: v.id("games"), move: moveValidator },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const game = await ctx.db.get(args.gameId);
    if (!game) throw new Error("Game not found");

    // Verify user is a player in this game
    if (game.player1Id !== ctx.userId && game.player2Id !== ctx.userId) {
      throw new Error("Unauthorized");
    }

    // Proceed with move validation and execution
  },
});
```

#### Secrets Management

- **Never commit secrets** to version control
- **Use environment variables** for configuration
- **Rotate secrets regularly**
- **Use secret management services** for production

### Dependency Security

```bash
# Regular dependency updates
bun update
bun audit

# Check for security vulnerabilities
