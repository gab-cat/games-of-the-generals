# Enable all rules by default (oxlint's default behavior)
# oxlint has built-in TypeScript and React support
# No need for separate plugins like ESLint

# Allow unused variables starting with underscore (matching ESLint config)
# Note: oxlint doesn't have the same rule system as ESLint
# This is handled by oxlint's default behavior
